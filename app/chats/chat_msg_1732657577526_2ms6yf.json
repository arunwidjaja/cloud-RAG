      "text": "RAG caching in this context refers to the caching strategy used in a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. Instead of caching raw embeddings, the system caches semantic search results, specifically query-document pairs, to make the system more efficient. This helps in returning the same documents without the need for vector search if the similarity threshold is above a certain value (0.85 in this case). The goal of RAG caching is to optimize the retrieval and generation process in the system.\n\nSources used: \nRAG caching.txt",
